# WWE Clicky Game

Test your memory with your favorite superstars from WWE.

The application renders a dozen different images from WWE to the screen.

Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once.

The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is incremented

If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is reset to 0.

The application keeps track of the users Best Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Best Score.
